Probability of Success or Failure of Startups Globally
Introduction
This repository aims to analyze and predict the probability of success or failure of startups globally based on various factors such as investments and funding rounds, sector and market, location, market conditions, funding dates, total funding rate, GDP growth in the country, technologies, inflation rates, political environment, ease of doing business, and more. The goal is to understand the key determinants of startup success and provide insights for investors, entrepreneurs, and policymakers.

Data Gathering
Collect data on startups from various sources such as Crunchbase, AngelList, PitchBook, etc.
Gather information on investments, funding rounds, sector, market, location, market conditions, funding dates, total funding rate, GDP growth, technologies, inflation rates, political environment, ease of doing business, and other relevant variables.
Visualizations
Distribution of Countries by Startup:

Visualize the number of startups in each country using a bar chart or a world map.
Distribution of Startups by Industry:

Create a pie chart or a bar chart to display the distribution of startups across different industries.
Distribution of Startups by Operating Status:

Show the percentage of startups categorized by their operating status (active, acquired, closed, etc.) using a pie chart or a bar chart.
Maps
Heatmap of Funding:

Create a geographical heatmap to visualize the concentration of funding in different regions/countries.
Heatmap of Probability of Success:

Generate a heatmap illustrating the probability of success for startups in different regions/countries.
Timelines
Timeline of Growth of Startups by Operating Status:

Plot a timeline chart showcasing the growth and changes in the operating status of startups over time.
Timeline of Acquisitions:

Create a timeline visualization to display the acquisitions of startups, indicating the dates and the acquiring companies.
Correlation Matrix
Generate a correlation matrix of the independent variables to identify relationships and dependencies among the factors influencing startup success or failure.
Average Value Round per Country
Calculate and visualize the average value of funding rounds for startups in different countries.
Debt and Type of Capital
Analyze the impact of debt and different types of capital on the success or failure of startups, and present the findings in a clear format.
Machine Learning Model
Supervised Learning: Probability of Success or Failure of Startups Globally

Develop a supervised machine learning model to predict the probability of success or failure for startups based on the available data. Evaluate and fine-tune the model for better accuracy.
Supervised Learning: Probability of Acquisition

Build another supervised machine learning model to predict the probability of acquisition for startups using relevant features. Evaluate and optimize the model to enhance prediction performance.
Unsupervised Learning: Clusterization

Apply unsupervised learning techniques (e.g., clustering algorithms like K-means) to group startups based on similarity and identify distinct patterns or segments.
Conclusion
This project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing the success or failure of startups globally. By analyzing and understanding these factors, we can help investors, entrepreneurs, and policymakers make informed decisions and support the growth of the startup ecosystem.
